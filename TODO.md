# TODO

## Front-End
* Better Front-End
* front end encryption and later decryption
* maybe drop-down menu with different options for time a paste should be saved

## Back-End
* cleaner code (esp. some borrowings, maybe use macros at some places)
* Update to new Rocket Version
* mount /api and create Functions/Routes accordingly. Over this handle back pure JSON instead of Templates
* store pastes as a whole (with needed additional information like creation time and lifetime) in database instead of file system
  * update logic behind it; remove_old_files() needs overhaul then!
