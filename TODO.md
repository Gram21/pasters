# TODO
* Better Front-End
* front end encryption and later decryption
* cleaner code (esp. some borrowings, maybe use macros at some places)
* maybe drop-down menu with different options for time a paste should be saved
  * according to that remove_old_files() needs an overhaul
* Maybe: Do not return rendered Template. Instead return JSON and use JS to fill values into correct places.
