# pasters
Small paste service written in Rust

# Usage
Clone the repository and build and run it with the following:
```
git clone https://github.com/Gram21/pasters.git
cd ./pasters
cargo run
```

This builds the debug version of the service and starts it. 
The service is then accessible at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

# TODO
* Better Front-End
* cleaner code
* generating a proper key needed for removing a paste
* maybe drop-down menu with different options for time a paste should be saved
